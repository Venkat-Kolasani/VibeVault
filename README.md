# VibeVault - Micro-Savings Demo Website

A comprehensive demo website showcasing VibeVault, an innovative micro-savings application designed for India's Gen-Z audience. This demo illustrates how small daily expenditures can be transformed into significant savings through gamified UPI round-up functionality.

### Build as a prototype for Microsoft SEFA-2025 Case Study Program

## 🎯 Project Overview

VibeVault is designed around the concept of "micro-savings" - automatically rounding up UPI transactions and saving the spare change toward meaningful goals. The app targets Gen-Z users in India who want to save for experiences like concerts, festivals, and travel without feeling the burden of traditional saving methods.

### Key Concept
Transform everyday transactions (like buying chai for ₹47) into savings opportunities by rounding up to ₹50 and saving the ₹3 difference. Over time, these micro-amounts accumulate toward larger goals like a ₹25,000 Sunburn festival ticket.
